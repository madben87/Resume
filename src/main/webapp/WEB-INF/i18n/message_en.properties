modal_java=Java - a strongly typed object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle). Java applications are usually broadcast in a special byte code, so they can run on any computer architecture, using Java-machine. Date of official release - May 23, 1995.\
\
Java programs are translated into bytecode that runs the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) - a program of processing and transmitting a byte code instructions to the hardware as an interpreter.\

The advantage of this method of program implementation is the complete independence of the bytecode from the operating system and hardware that enables Java-based applications on any device for which there is a corresponding virtual machine. Another important feature of Java technology is a flexible security system, in which the execution of the program is fully controlled by the virtual machine. Any transactions that exceed the established authority of the program (for example, an unauthorized attempt to access the data or connect to another computer), cause an immediate interrupt.\
\
Often, the disadvantages of the virtual machine concept include reduced productivity. A number of improvements a few increased speed of execution of Java programs:\
\
the use of translation technology bytecode into machine code at run-time program (JIT-technology) to store versions of a class in machine code,\
extensive use of platform-oriented code (native-code) in the standard library,\
hardware, providing accelerated processing of the byte-code (for example, Jazelle technology, favored by some of the company ARM processors).\
According shootout.alioth.debian.org site for seven different tasks on the Java Runtime averages a half to two times more than the C / C ++, Java, in some cases more rapidly, and in some cases 7 times slower. On the other hand, for most of them Java-machine memory consumption was 10-30 times larger than the program for the C / C ++. Also noteworthy study conducted by Google, according to which there is a significant lower performance and more memory consumption in test cases in Java in comparison with similar programs in C ++.\
\
The ideas embodied in the concept and the different implementations of the Java virtual machine environment, inspired a lot of enthusiasts to expand the list of languages ​​that could be used to create programs that are executed on the virtual machine. These ideas also found expression in the Common Language Infrastructure specification CLI, underlying the .NET Framework by Microsoft.
modal_junit=JUnit - library for unit testing of software in Java.\
\
Created by Kent Beck and Eric Gamma, the JUnit belongs to the family of xUnit frameworks for different programming languages, originating in SUnit Kent Beck for Smalltalk. JUnit has spawned an ecosystem of extensions - JMock, EasyMock, DbUnit, HttpUnit etc...\
\
JUnit has been ported to other languages, including PHP (PHPUnit), C # (NUnit), Python (PyUnit), Fortran (fUnit), Delphi (DUnit), Free Pascal (FPCUnit), Perl (Test :: Unit), C + + (CPPUnit ), Flex (FlexUnit), JavaScript (JSUnit), COS (COSUnit).\
\
The experience gained from working with the JUnit, it is important in the development of software testing concepts.
modal_js=JavaScript - Prototype-based scenario programming language. It is the realization of the ECMAScript language (ECMA-262 standard).\
\
JavaScript is commonly used as an embedded language for programmatic access to application objects. The most widely used is browsers like scripting language to make interactive web pages.\
\
The main architectural features: dynamic typing, weak typing, automatic memory management, prototype-based programming, function as a first-class objects.\
\
On JavaScript was influenced by many languages, the design goal was to make a language similar to Java, but at the same time easy to use nonprogrammer. JavaScript language does not own any company or organization that distinguishes it from a number of programming languages ​​used in web development\
\
HTML (from the English HyperText Markup Language -. «Hypertext Markup Language") - a standardized markup language documents on the World Wide Web. Most Web pages contain a description of the markup language HTML (or XHTML). HTML language is interpreted by browsers; resulting from the interpretation of the formatted text displayed on a computer screen or mobile device.\
\
Language HTML is an application of SGML (standard generalized markup language) and complies with the international ISO 8879 standard.\
\
Language XHTML is a stricter version HTML, it follows all the XML constraints and, in fact, XHTML can be seen as an application of XML to the field of hypertext markup.\
\
The World Wide Web HTML-pages are usually transferred from the browser over HTTP or HTTPS server in plain text or using encryption.\
\
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets -. Cascading Style Sheets) - a formal language for describing the appearance of a document written using the markup language.\
\
Mostly used as a means of description, the appearance of the web pages written in HTML and XHTML markup languages, but can also be applied to any of the XML-documents, such as SVG, or XUL.
modal_jdbc=JDBC - a platform-independent industry standard Java-based applications interact with different DBMS implemented as java.sql package, which is part of Java SE.\
\
JDBC is based on the concept of so-called drivers, allow to obtain a connection to a specially described URL data. Drivers can be loaded dynamically (at runtime). After loading, the driver itself registers itself and is called automatically when a program requires the URL, containing the protocol for which the driver is responsible.
modal_spring=Spring Framework - a universal framework to open source Java-platform. There is also a fork of the .NET Framework, called Spring.NET\
\
The first version was written by Rod Johnson, who first published it, together with the publication of his book «Expert One-on-One Java EE Design and Development»\
\
Spring has its own MVC-platform web application, which was not originally planned. Spring developers decided to write it as a reaction to what they perceived as a failure of the design (then) popular Apache Struts, as well as other available web frameworks. In particular, in their opinion, it was insufficient separation between the layers of the submission and processing of requests, as well as between the layer model and query processing.\
\

modal_maven=Maven provides a declarative rather than imperative (unlike Apache Ant build automation) assembly project. The project file contains its specification, and not the individual performance of the team. All tasks for file processing described in the specification, the Maven performs through processing sequence of built-in and external plug-ins.\
\
Maven is used to build and project management, written in Java, C #, Ruby, Scala, and other languages
modal_mysql=MySQL - free relational database management system. Development and support for MySQL, Oracle provides, won the right to the trademark, together with the absorbed Sun Microsystems, which had previously acquired the Swedish company MySQL AB. The product is distributed as under the GNU General Public License, as well as under its own commercial license. In addition, the developers create the functionality of licensed users on request. It is through this order is almost the earliest versions appeared replication mechanism.
modal_tomcat=Tomcat (in older versions - Catalina) - servlet engine open source, developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It implements the Servlet specification, and the specification of JavaServer Pages (JSP) and JavaServer Faces (JSF). It is written in Java.\
\
Tomcat allows you to run a Web application that contains a number of programs for self-configuration.\
\
Tomcat is used as a standalone Web server, as a content server in conjunction with the Apache HTTP Server Web server, as well as the servlet container in JBoss application server and GlassFish.
modal_glassfish=GlassFish - the application server open source software that implements the Java EE specification, originally developed by Sun Microsystems. Currently sponsored by Oracle Corporation. Current version of the platform called Oracle GlassFish Server.\
\
The basis of the GlassFish Java code formed part of System Application Server and Sun's ORM TopLink (solution for storing Java objects in relational databases, provided by Oracle). As a servlet container it uses a modified Apache Tomcat, supplemented by component Grizzly, using Java NIO technology.
modal_hibernate=Hibernate - a library for the Java programming language, designed to meet the challenges of object-relational mapping (ORM), is distributed freely under the terms of GNU Lesser General Public License.\
\
Hibernate The aim is to free the developer from a large volume of relatively low-level programming when working in object-oriented means in a relational database. The developer can use Hibernate in the process of designing classes and system "from scratch" tables, and to work with an existing database.\
\
The library not only solves the problem of communication of Java classes to database tables (and Java to SQL data types, data types), but also provides a means for automatically generating and updating a set of tables, building queries and processing the data and can significantly reduce development time, which usually spent on manual writing and JDBC-SQL- code. Hibernate automates the generation of SQL-queries and frees the developer from manual processing of the result set data and transform objects, making it easy to maximize the transfer (porting) applications on any SQL database.
modal_jsp=JSP (JavaServer Pages) - a technology that allows web developers to create content that is both static and dynamic components. JSP page contains text of two types: static data source, which can be executed in one of the text formats HTML, SVG, WML, or XML, and JSP- elements that construct the dynamic content. Also it can be used-the JSP tag library, as well as EL (Expression Language), for the introduction of Java-code in JSP-pages static content.\
\
The JSP-page code is translated into the Java servlet code using the JSP compiler-pages of Jasper, and then compiled into bytecode virtual machine java (JVM). Servlet containers that can perform JSP-page written in a platform-independent language Java. JSP-pages load on the server and are managed from a special structure of Java server packet, called a Java EE Web Application. Usually pages are packed in file archives .war and .ear.

modal_jpa=Java Persistence API (JPA) - API, included with the Java version 5 of the Java SE and Java EE platform, provides the ability to save in a convenient form of Java-objects in a database.\
\
There are several implementations of this interface, one of the most popular uses for this Hibernate. JPA implements the concept of ORM.\
\
Support for data integrity provided by the JPA, covers an area:\
\
directly API, javax.persistentse a predetermined packet;\
\
platform-independent object-oriented language Java queries\
